# STEM Fellowship Big Data Challenge Workshops

I work with STEM Fellowship, a student-run, national organization that promotes technical, research, and data science skills at the high school and undergraduate level across Canada. I'm a member of their data science team, which hosts the annual Big Data Challenge, sponsored by IBM, SAS, SciNet, and Altmetric. Learn more about the competition [here.](stemfellowship.org/big-data-challenge/)

As a member of the data science team, I help to prepare data science workshops for high school and undergraduate students to use in the Big Data Challenge, as well as potentially for a partnership with UBC's Masters Flex program.
