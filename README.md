# STEM Fellowship Big Data Challenge Workshops

I work with STEM Fellowship, a student-run, national organization that promotes technical, research, and data science skills at the high school and undergraduate level across Canada. I'm a member of their data science team, which hosts the annual Big Data Challenge, sponsored by IBM, SAS, SciNet, and Altmetric. Learn more about the competition [here.](http://stemfellowship.org/big-data-challenge/)

As a member of the data science team, I help to prepare data science workshops for high school and undergraduate students to use in the Big Data Challenge, as well as potentially for a partnership with UBC's Masters Flex program.

## Workshops

### Week 3, Part 1: [K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/jacobdanovitch/Data-Science-Workshops/blob/master/K%20Means%20Clustering.ipynb)
An introduction to the idea of unsupervised learning, clustering, and data visualization.

### Week 3, Part 2: [Linear Regression and Gradient Descent](https://github.com/jacobdanovitch/Data-Science-Workshops/blob/master/Linear%20Regression.ipynb)
An overview of classical linear regression, introducing the main concepts of machine learning (minimizing cost functions), using Gradient Descent for single and multivariate linear regression.

### Upcoming
